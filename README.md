# iTop-Project-Class
Most of our asset are linked to a project (wich is a very conceptual class :) This class is amed to store our project references, and to link them with our asset.

This class will probably be 'my work centric' :) I'm not really sure that the terminology can be seen as generic. Anyway, if it can give ideas to others...
